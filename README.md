## Advanced Java PGR200

This was part of the exam in PGR200

### Task from Visma ###

Open the _Solution Description_ located under main/resources. The aim here is to 
use the _functional needs_ and _test conditions_ to create tests and classes
with titles that match the solutions needs (eg shouldCreateNewOrderObjectTest).

The next task is to create the classes and implement the methods in a logical
manner. However, we are not cavemen, we use tools like IntelliJ.
So create the necessary classes and Alt+Enter yourself a test class.

#### Result ####

to handle all the exceptions i needed for input and output.
Also made test for all methods in test folder for ShopService and ShopRepository
